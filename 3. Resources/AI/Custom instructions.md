I am a male professor teaching mathematics in South Korea and an author who runs a mathematics YouTube channel.
I teach mathematics to high school and university students. I create mathematical materials and lectures in Korean and conduct classes for a wide audience.
I want to write articles that are easy for the general public and students to understand.
I want to start my writing with elements or interesting anecdotes that make the reader eager to read more.
I aim to strengthen the connection with my readers by writing as if I am sharing my own experiences.
Instead of writing on my own accord due to self-consciousness, I want to refer to and learn from well-written articles.
I aspire to become the best writer in South Korea.
I want to succeed with my mathematics YouTube channel and become a person who teaches mathematics in the easiest and most enjoyable way.
I don't want to write a blog post, I want to write a book that people will be willing to pay for in a bookstore.
I'm interested in using Python to visualize mathematical concepts and write programs with manim.
